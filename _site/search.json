The end result was to characterize each manager’s season from\r\nweek to week across six categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nNC State Women’s Tennis\r\nThis dashboard request originated from the Head Coach of NC State Women’s Tennis\r\nwhich shines as a top-5 program thanks to his trust in analytics. The goal of\r\nthe project was to deliver 19 KPIs across both players and team over the past three\r\nyears. The end result was 4 unique dashboards on a title page for Coach Secker\r\nwhich he selected to leverage for this upcoming recruiting season!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

From witnessing the pure bliss of\r\ncheering a victory together, to comforting each other in times of playoff defeat, the love I felt left\r\na permanent impression. Every season we rode the emotional rollercoaster of a Panthers fan with\r\nhope remaining each year that a Super Bowl victory was on the horizon.\r\nMy passion for numbers was continuously present throughout college as I found\r\nopportunities outside of the business school in the UNC Basketball Team and extra economics\r\nclasses that exercised my statistics skills. These accomplishments connected data to outcomes in\r\na practical way that resonated with the type of analyses that are exciting to me such as analyzing\r\nplayer tendencies for coaches or weekly economic data to assess financial market conditions.\r\nMy finance experiences were exclusively on the mergers & acquisitions side valuing companies based on\r\ndifferent financial analyses. I gained a robust investment knowledge that coupled well with my\r\nundergraduate degree; but quickly realized my excitement wasn’t evaluating businesses for a\r\ndollar amount, rather it lied in contributing to a businesses’ competitive advantage that generated\r\nthese valuations in the first place for Investment Banks.\r\nWith a year of experience in a startup culture at Red Ventures, shifting to Wells Fargo\r\nprovided a different perspective in regards to how larger corporations manage and innovate their\r\ndatabase systems. I encountered this perspective running another migration project, now at the bank,\r\nwhich exposed me to significantly more data volume and downstream impact than a start-up\r\nenvironment. This project continued to exercise my communication and collaboration skills, as it\r\nwas completed remotely and involved international groups. Both of my database migration\r\nprojects accelerated my understanding of the entire data process from creation to\r\nimplementation; however, I remained passionate about the post-implementation side of data\r\nwhere it’s manipulated and analyzed to drive insights, as this aligns with my true career goals\r\nand kept the Institute for Analytics top of mind.\r\nBoth my professional experiences and undergraduate studies highlighted how finance and\r\ndata impact virtually everything in society, and understanding their implication is the best way to\r\ngain useful, performable information. When evaluating my data aptitude, I recognized the one\r\nexplicit gap in being a well-rounded data analyst was my lack of mathematical and practical\r\neducation deriving data to garner and communicate insights. The Institute for Analytics has been the\r\ndream opportunity to build a complete foundation in the field where I was fortunate to discover\r\nmy passion.\r\nNow that I’m in the program, I’m very fortunate to be continuously fulfilling my mathematics and\r\nstatistics curiosity in an analytics application. Furthermore, the opportunity to unite with a\r\nlarge, diverse group of like-minded individuals has been special and produced an environment\r\nthat’s been a pleasure to subscribe to daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
