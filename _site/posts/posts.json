All that joy stemmed from a newfound feeling I had been searching for in efforts to elevate my pedigree and skills to add value somewhere worthwhile – hope. And with hope being one of the most powerful forces in the world, I’m forever indebted to the Institute for cultivating and inviting me into their world-class environment. Now that almost half the master’s program is complete, I’m in awe of the skillsets developed across the entire class. My goal of this online analytics portfolio is to apply my data skills to a variety of topics that I’ve always wanted to explore and contextualize analytically but didn’t have the appropriate toolkit at the time.\r\nBuild\r\nAfter learning R Studio at the beginning of the program, my peer and classmate Ben Wagner pointed me to the {distill} package in R which leverages R-Markdown files that are rendered into HTML files to build a website. This route seemed to offer the most flexibility from a code and design perspective, without having to know too much HTML for the small site details. There are also quite a few {distill} website examples on the internet and GitHub that helped with my website’s construction. While my business experiences mainly related to dollar amounts, I appreciated the new UX design perspective necessary to hone for one’s website as this led to considerations mainly across the home page, navigation bar, blog section, and dashboard tab of the website.\r\nWhat’s Next\r\nThe online portfolio took about one-and-a-half months to stand-up with the help of GoDaddy as a domain provider and Lisa Lendway as the {distill} Sherpa. With the pillars of the website up and running, this {distill} project gave me an awesome opportunity to further explore and apply my R knowledge. I’m thrilled to soon highlight my statistical work in R, showcase my Python skills, and leverage Tableau to communicate any insights. I couldn’t be more thankful for the past year and how it’s influenced all the years to come.\r\nResources\r\nBelow are the links I used to help me with this website endeavor, I’m sure you’ll find them useful too if\r\nyou’re interested in pursuing something similar.\r\nhttps://lisalendway.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-09-buildingdistill\r\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html\r\nhttps://pkgs.rstudio.com/distill/articles/examples.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
