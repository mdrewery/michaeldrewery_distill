    "contents": "\r\nThe beginning of my master’s program curriculum introduced linear regression as the introduction to model building. In practice, we were learning how to build this out in R, so it was exciting to progress in a new skill I came into the program looking to learn. This process timed well with the annual Fantasy Football Draft frenzy in August/September before the season begins. I’ve been playing for almost ten years now and was excited to apply some analytical skills to one of my many sports hobbies.\r\nI understood my limitations with the predictions from a linear regression, and quite frankly didn’t see the value in generating an ordered list of projected points for players, as that never seemed to help with decision making in years past. “What if a few of your target players get drafted, how do re-prioritize remaining players?” was the question in the back of my mind. So from my perspective, there was more value in identifying key relationships in certain stats to fantasy point output, so I could have a fluid evaluation tool throughout the entire Fantasy Draft. I was specifically interested in identifying key metrics to compare between wide receivers as this position group is obviously the largest amount of players to choose from out of all position groups, and they usually take up the most roster spots per team.\r\nThe data utilized was a graded receiving summary from PFF for the years 2014-2019 which has a mix of raw statistics from the respective year and the company’s graded data assessing performance (0-100), every play, that’s aggregated to the game or season level. The next step was everyone’s favorite part, but definitely most crucial, and that was data cleaning. Teams’ locations change, players change names, and there are even players with the same name so all needs to be accounted for before moving on from exploratory data analysis.\r\n\r\n'data.frame':   476 obs. of  28 variables:\r\n $ year                           : int  2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 ...\r\n $ player                         : chr  \"Antonio Brown\" \"Demaryius Thomas\" \"Julio Jones\" \"Jordy Nelson\" ...\r\n $ player_id                      : int  5718 5547 6158 4350 8663 1319 5606 4942 2278 5585 ...\r\n $ position                       : chr  \"WR\" \"WR\" \"WR\" \"WR\" ...\r\n $ player_game_count              : int  16 16 15 16 16 15 16 16 16 16 ...\r\n $ team_name                      : chr  \"PIT\" \"DEN\" \"ATL\" \"GB\" ...\r\n $ targets                        : int  178 178 156 146 142 141 140 140 138 136 ...\r\n $ receptions                     : int  129 111 104 98 73 85 101 85 70 99 ...\r\n $ caught_percent                 : num  72.5 62.4 66.7 67.1 51.4 60.3 72.1 60.7 50.7 72.8 ...\r\n $ yards                          : int  1698 1619 1593 1519 1008 936 1409 1318 1002 1331 ...\r\n $ touchdowns                     : int  13 11 6 13 9 3 9 10 2 4 ...\r\n $ grades_offense                 : num  91.2 89.9 89.8 89.4 73.5 75.3 87.9 80.6 75.7 79.3 ...\r\n $ grades_pass_route              : num  91.2 89.9 88 87.8 73.2 74.2 89.9 80.3 75.1 80.1 ...\r\n $ grades_hands_drop              : num  89.7 63.4 63.5 51.9 33.9 55.5 90.1 90.8 57.5 76.3 ...\r\n $ grades_hands_fumble            : num  72.5 84.4 34.8 85.2 49.6 24.8 61.8 83 48.1 59.8 ...\r\n $ grades_pass_block              : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\r\n $ yards_per_reception            : num  13.2 14.6 15.3 15.5 13.8 11 14 15.5 14.3 13.4 ...\r\n $ yards_after_catch              : int  615 668 553 519 177 383 381 511 159 709 ...\r\n $ yards_after_catch_per_reception: num  4.8 6 5.3 5.3 2.4 4.5 3.8 6 2.3 7.2 ...\r\n $ longest                        : int  63 86 79 80 51 35 48 72 50 73 ...\r\n $ first_downs                    : int  86 69 76 71 52 49 69 56 51 58 ...\r\n $ drops                          : int  5 9 8 8 11 9 2 1 7 6 ...\r\n $ interceptions                  : int  3 6 4 1 3 3 2 7 6 3 ...\r\n $ fumbles                        : int  1 0 2 0 1 3 1 0 1 1 ...\r\n $ avoided_tackles                : int  17 11 16 14 9 6 8 8 6 20 ...\r\n $ targeted_qb_rating             : num  119.5 98.5 102.3 128.2 86.8 ...\r\n $ penalties                      : int  5 4 2 1 7 1 5 3 2 1 ...\r\n $ declined_penalties             : int  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ...\r\n\r\nAfter my data manipulation step, I wanted to filter down on players in the data with more than 15 targets. From there I created my target variable “Fantasy_WR_Total”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was curious how the offensive line performance impacted wide receiver fantasy production so I added PFF’s pass blocking efficiency grade to the data as another variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping just player ID and year with all the other numeric and graded fields, I was ready to test assumptions before model building. I’ll spare you the nuances of the assumption testing here as it’s commented in the code below.\r\n\r\n                           year                     player_id.x \r\n                       1.269836                        1.267702 \r\n              player_game_count                         targets \r\n                       1.347340                       18.628961 \r\n                 caught_percent                      touchdowns \r\n                       5.536371                        4.132658 \r\n                 grades_offense               grades_pass_route \r\n                       3.508169                        4.266172 \r\n              grades_hands_drop             yards_per_reception \r\n                       1.797770                        3.150973 \r\nyards_after_catch_per_reception                     first_downs \r\n                       1.948227                       21.143986 \r\n                avoided_tackles              targeted_qb_rating \r\n                       2.269683                        3.954642 \r\n                            pbe \r\n                       1.036638 \r\n'data.frame':   1648 obs. of  16 variables:\r\n $ year                           : int  2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 ...\r\n $ player_id.x                    : int  5718 5547 6158 4350 8663 1319 5606 4942 2278 5585 ...\r\n $ player_game_count              : int  16 16 15 16 16 15 16 16 16 16 ...\r\n $ targets                        : int  178 178 156 146 142 141 140 140 138 136 ...\r\n $ caught_percent                 : num  72.5 62.4 66.7 67.1 51.4 60.3 72.1 60.7 50.7 72.8 ...\r\n $ touchdowns                     : int  13 11 6 13 9 3 9 10 2 4 ...\r\n $ grades_offense                 : num  91.2 89.9 89.8 89.4 73.5 75.3 87.9 80.6 75.7 79.3 ...\r\n $ grades_pass_route              : num  91.2 89.9 88 87.8 73.2 74.2 89.9 80.3 75.1 80.1 ...\r\n $ grades_hands_drop              : num  89.7 63.4 63.5 51.9 33.9 55.5 90.1 90.8 57.5 76.3 ...\r\n $ yards_per_reception            : num  13.2 14.6 15.3 15.5 13.8 11 14 15.5 14.3 13.4 ...\r\n $ yards_after_catch_per_reception: num  4.8 6 5.3 5.3 2.4 4.5 3.8 6 2.3 7.2 ...\r\n $ first_downs                    : int  86 69 76 71 52 49 69 56 51 58 ...\r\n $ avoided_tackles                : int  17 11 16 14 9 6 8 8 6 20 ...\r\n $ targeted_qb_rating             : num  119.5 98.5 102.3 128.2 86.8 ...\r\n $ Fantasy_WR_Total               : num  312 283 247 279 191 ...\r\n $ pbe                            : num  86.9 90.1 83.8 89.1 83.2 86.2 90.1 86.9 82.3 84.9 ...\r\n                           year                     player_id.x \r\n                       1.269836                        1.267702 \r\n              player_game_count                         targets \r\n                       1.347340                       18.628961 \r\n                 caught_percent                      touchdowns \r\n                       5.536371                        4.132658 \r\n                 grades_offense               grades_pass_route \r\n                       3.508169                        4.266172 \r\n              grades_hands_drop             yards_per_reception \r\n                       1.797770                        3.150973 \r\nyards_after_catch_per_reception                     first_downs \r\n                       1.948227                       21.143986 \r\n                avoided_tackles              targeted_qb_rating \r\n                       2.269683                        3.954642 \r\n                            pbe \r\n                       1.036638 \r\n\r\n\r\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\r\n\r\ndata:  x and y\r\nS = 554016517, p-value < 2.2e-16\r\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\r\nsample estimates:\r\n      rho \r\n0.2573187 \r\n\r\n\r\n    Anderson-Darling normality test\r\n\r\ndata:  resid(lm.modelv2)\r\nA = 18.096, p-value < 2.2e-16\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce I confirmed the assumptions I moved onto the cor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nIntro\r\nAbout this time last year, I was hugging my mom with pure joy in the car of the Hyundai Dealership in Rock Hill, SC as I received the news of being selected for an interview at the Institute for Advanced Analytics. All that joy stemmed from a newfound feeling I had been searching for in efforts to elevate my pedigree and skills to add value somewhere worthwhile – hope. And with hope being one of the most powerful forces in the world, I’m forever indebted to the Institute for cultivating and inviting me into their world-class environment. Now that almost half the master’s program is complete, I’m in awe of the skillsets developed across the entire class. My goal of this online analytics portfolio is to apply my data skills to a variety of topics that I’ve always wanted to explore and contextualize analytically but didn’t have the appropriate toolkit at the time.\r\nBuild\r\nAfter learning R Studio at the beginning of the program, my peer and classmate Ben Wagner pointed me to the {distill} package in R which leverages R-Markdown files that are rendered into HTML files to build a website. This route seemed to offer the most flexibility from a code and design perspective, without having to know too much HTML for the small site details. There are also quite a few {distill} website examples on the internet and GitHub that helped with my website’s construction. While my business experiences mainly related to dollar amounts, I appreciated the new UX design perspective necessary to hone for one’s website as this led to considerations mainly across the home page, navigation bar, blog section, and dashboard tab of the website.\r\nWhat’s Next\r\nThe online portfolio took about one-and-a-half months to stand-up with the help of GoDaddy as a domain provider and Lisa Lendway as the {distill} Sherpa. With the pillars of the website up and running, this {distill} project gave me an awesome opportunity to further explore and apply my R knowledge. I’m thrilled to soon highlight my statistical work in R, showcase my Python skills, and leverage Tableau to communicate any insights. I couldn’t be more thankful for the past year and how it’s influenced all the years to come.\r\nResources\r\nBelow are the links I used to help me with this website endeavor, I’m sure you’ll find them useful too if\r\nyou’re interested in pursuing something similar.\r\nhttps://lisalendway.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-09-buildingdistill\r\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html\r\nhttps://pkgs.rstudio.com/distill/articles/examples.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
